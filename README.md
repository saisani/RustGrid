# RustGrid
Implementation of a mesh grid using Rust

### Goals
The goal is to implement an efficent algorithm for an adh hoc network with the following properties:
-- Not congest the Network 
-- Self-heal as paths/nodes are unavailable
-- Able to scale well as more nodes are added

### To-Do
[ ] Develop Basic structure for Packet and Node
[ ] Simulate real-life conditions for an ad hoc mesh-network
[ ] Everthing else... lol


### Setup
```
$ npm install
```

### Run
```
npm start
```

### Build
```
npm run build
```
